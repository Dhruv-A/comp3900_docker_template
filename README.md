# COMP3900 Docker Installation Template

In this course, you must use Docker. To make sure you have everything set up and can run docker comfortably, you will need to complete this short exercise and show your tutor in Week 3 lab time.

**Successful completion of this task is required for your participation mark in Week 3**

# Step 1: Installing Docker

You can download docker at the following https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
Once you download and install it, open it and ensure it is running whenever you are developing your code.

# Step 2: Clone this repo

Clone this repo (if you don't know how to do this, refer to the Git primer which you are also required to complete by Week 3 lab time)

# Step 3: Run the container

Run

```docker-compose up```

It might take a while for it to install everything required (2-5 mins is normal)

# Step 4: Testing that everything is working

Go to `localhost:3333` on a web browser and if everything is working it should display `Test: PASSED`


Please ensure you have completed this early so that if you have issues, we have time to help you on Ed forum or in your Week 2 lab.
